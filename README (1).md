# 🧠 Trader Sentiment Analysis

An intelligent NLP-powered system that classifies trader sentiment (bullish, bearish, or neutral) from social media and news text.  
This project uses machine learning and natural language processing techniques to analyze public market sentiment and visualize the trends interactively.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Trader Sentiment Analysis** is designed to extract and analyze sentiments expressed by traders and investors across financial discussions, news articles, and social media posts.  
By combining text preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning, it helps identify market sentiment patterns that could influence trading decisions.

---

## 🧩 Features

- 🔍 **Data Preprocessing** — Cleaning and tokenizing raw text using `nltk` and `re`.  
- 🧠 **Sentiment Classification** — Machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.) trained on labeled sentiment data.  
- 📊 **Visualization Dashboard** — Graphs and charts showing sentiment distribution and accuracy metrics.  
- ⚙️ **Scalable Pipeline** — Easily extendable for live sentiment tracking using APIs like Twitter or Reddit.  
- 💬 **Explainable Results** — Outputs probabilities and visualizations for each sentiment class.
